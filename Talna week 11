Week 11: Exception Handling
Task Summary:
Write a C++ program that demonstrates exception handling using try, throw, and catch.
1.	Key Concept
Exception handling prevents program crash by catching runtime errors such as:
Division by zero
Invalid input
Negative numbers
2.	Pseudocode

BEGIN
  READ two numbers a, b
  TRY
     IF b == 0
        THROW error
     ELSE
        Result = a / b
        PRINT result
     END IF
  CATCH error
     PRINT “Cannot divide by zero”
  END TRY
END
3.	C++ Program
Copy code
Cpp
#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;

Int main() {
    Int a, b;

    Cout << “Enter two numbers: “;
    Cin >> a >> b;

    Try {
        If (b == 0)
            Throw b;

        Cout << “Result = “ << a / b << endl;
    }
    Catch (int) {
        Cout << “Error: Cannot divide by zero!” << endl;
    }

    Return 0;
}
